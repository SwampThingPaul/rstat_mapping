# Mapping In R

To date mapping in R has been very limited and frustrating. As many people have noted that R is not a mapping software. Its not really a geospatial analysis software however with the develope of more and more packages and the evolution of R.

This repository houses a geospatial database (.gdb) assembled in ArcGIS, several comma-seperated files (.csv) and a basic R script developed for this repositiory.
